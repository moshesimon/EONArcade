 Arcade game simulating an EON 

 Hi!

 I have 2 versions of my game.
 One randomly generates the available slots each round and one starts with empty slots and each round gets more full.
 The second game is a game of evolution. You need to think ahead! (a bit like tetris) 

 The rules of the game are as follows:
 You are required to select a path from the source node to the target node, using the links located on the right of the screen.
 You must also pick the slots in the spectrum that are available and continuous along the whole path.
 Good luck!

 don't forget to active the env!
 Just run the command: 
 	
    cmd.exe -> .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    PowerShell -> .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
